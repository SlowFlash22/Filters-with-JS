# Particle Rain Effect(B&W):
- This project uses canvas through VanillaJS.
- Manipulated pixels to become larger at more bright places so you can look at it.
- Pixels get smaller in darker parts of image.
- Made an image into a string so that I won't have to upload a softcopy of image that occupies space.
